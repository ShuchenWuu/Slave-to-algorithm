## Summary

We had a rapid presentation this week. Here is where I am at the moment.

I figure out the core function of my system/although I experiment with functions separately (to reduce the possibility of having mistakes and can not get a result). 


Feel the pressure from peers, by the pressure I mean my progress bar. I am still in a place to adjust all the functions and plan to do interface/design after I make the system running complete.
