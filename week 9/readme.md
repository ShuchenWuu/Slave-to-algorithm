## Summary

We had a rapid presentation this week. Here is where I am at the moment.

I figure out the core function of my system/although I experiment with functions separately (to reduce the possibility of having mistakes and can not get a result). 


Feel the pressure from peers, by the pressure I mean my progress bar. I am still in a place to adjust all the functions and plan to do interface/design after I make the system running complete.

## Workshop

Through the workshop, I learned some spilt canvas which I think could be very useful for my system. If there is two canvas I could have more space/potential with (x,y), means those lines can go beyond the box I set but can not be seen. And also more accessible for users to save their drawings, not the whole page but the second canvas only.

And Perlin noise, a class of random noise. Could be used for random lines. This is a fantastic effect done with Perlin noise.

We did some exercise with sentence slice. Simple but elegant.
