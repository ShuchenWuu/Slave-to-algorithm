## Summary

We had a rapid presentation this week. Here is where I am at the moment.

I figure out the core function of my system/although I experiment with functions separately (to reduce the possibility of having mistakes and can not get a result). 


Feel the pressure from peers, by the pressure I mean my progress bar. I am still in a place to adjust all the functions and plan to do interface/design after I make the system running complete.

## Workshop

Through the workshop, I learned some spilt canvas which I think could be very useful for my system. If there is two canvas I could have more space/potential with (x,y), means those lines can go beyond the box I set but can not be seen. And also more accessible for users to save their drawings, not the whole page but the second canvas only.

And Perlin noise, a class of random noise. Could be used for random lines. This is a fantastic effect done with Perlin noise.

We did some exercise with sentence slice. Simple but elegant.

## Process of my project
1. Confine speech to text, text to charCode and charCode to Drawing. 
knowledge gain:(parselnt()) takes integer only, in case the number of characters can not be divided by the algorithm

2. The function of selecting a letter.
Knowledge gain: return function—Specifies the value to be returned by a function. 

3. Selecting colours for drawing

4. Mode of Drawing (line, begin shape & end shape)
I am following the plan that I had on week 6. However, I found that I can not see the massive difference between Shape with triangle and polygon.

### Changed plan

### Changed plan
- More modes of shapes. Could be ellipses, rectangles
</br>
- Creating a second canvas to save images and provide more freedom for the Drawing.
