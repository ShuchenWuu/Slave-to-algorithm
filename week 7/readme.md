## Pseudocode
Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. It is easier for human to read, so the pseudocode that I create for my project, it's more like a note for me to process my code.

Activity that I have done during the class

Laundry

INPUT day/time
INPUT colour of clothes (dark or light)

IF Thursday 10am
 
Function sort {
  Sort clothes into two parts by colours, dark or light 
  Let dark clothes = 1, light clothes = 2
  output number
}
  
Function timer{
  If time = 1 hour 30 mins
  Ring the bell
}

IN output = 1, put 1 in the washing machine

timer()
  Take out clothes

ELSE IF, output=2, put 2 in the washing machines
timer()
  Take out clothes

END IF

## Pseudocode for my project (only for the generative part)

IF value of slider 1 = x1; (min=2, max=8)
The sides of the shape drawing on the canvas is x1;

IF value of slider 2 = x2; (min=10, max=50)
x2 added when the same character occur;

IF value of slider 3 = x3; (min=1, max=26)
Let A=1, B=2…then Z=26;
Then the character that user choose is x3;

IF value of slider 4 = R; (min=0, max=255);
IF value of slider 5 = G; (min=0, max=255);
IF value of slider 6 = B; (min=0, max=255);
The colour of the selected character is (R,G,B);

IF “start” is pressed
Speech to text

INPUT ASCII chart(A=65,B=66,C=67,D=68), character;
IF text = ABCD;
line(65,66,67,68);

OUTPUT drawing;
