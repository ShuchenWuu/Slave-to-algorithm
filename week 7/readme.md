## Pseudocode
Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normalÂ programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. It is easier for human to read, so the pseudocode that I create for my project, it's more like a note for me to process my code.

Activity that I have done during the class

Laundry

INPUT day/time
INPUT colour of clothes (dark or light)

IF Thursday 10am
 
Function sort {
  Sort clothes into two parts by colours, dark or light 
  Let dark clothes = 1, light clothes = 2
  output number
}
  
Function timer{
  If time = 1 hour 30 mins
  Ring the bell
}

IN output = 1, put 1 in the washing machine

timer()
  Take out clothes

ELSE IF, output=2, put 2 in the washing machines
timer()
  Take out clothes

END IF
