Our group chooses a block-breaking game as an example. It is fun and fast; the interactive surface of the product could be visualized easily.

I learn a new way of prototyping, which is more obvious for the designer to design the journey of how the system interacts with users. Easy to make, clear to read, convenient to change.<br />

## web & portfolio

Some websites that I found very interesting from Karen’s list.

Uncanny Valley Studios https://uncannyvalley.studio/
<br />
Studio Wrk https://waaark.com/studio/

Going through what other artists/students’ website, I found that it does not need to be very complicated, just some showcase work. With a bit of patience and some practice, I can make my own one day.

## In-class Lecture

EyeWriter - social design<br />
![](https://github.com/ShuchenWuu/Slave-to-algorithm/blob/master/week%206/download.jpeg)
Members of Free Art and Technology (FAT), OpenFrameworks, the Graffiti Research Lab, and The Ebeling Group communities have teamed-up with a legendary LA graffiti writer, publisher and activist, named TEMPTONE. Tempt1 was diagnosed with ALS in 2003, a disease which has left him almost completely physically paralyzed… except for his eyes. This international team is working together to create a low-cost, open source eye-tracking system that will allow ALS patients to draw using just their eyes. The long-term goal is to create a professional/social network of software developers, hardware hackers, urban projection artists and ALS patients from around the world who are using local materials and open source research to creatively connect and make eye art.
