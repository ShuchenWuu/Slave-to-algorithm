Our group chooses a block-breaking game as an example. It is fun and fast; the interactive surface of the product could be visualized easily.

I learn a new way of prototyping, which is more obvious for the designer to design the journey of how the system interacts with users. Easy to make, clear to read, convenient to change.<br />

## web & portfolio
Some websites that I found very interesting from Karen’s list.

Uncanny Valley Studios https://uncannyvalley.studio/
Studio Wrk https://waaark.com/studio/

Going through what other artists/students’ website, I found that it does not need to be very complicated, just some showcase work. With a bit of patience and some practice, I can make my own one day.
