Our group chooses a block-breaking game as an example. It is fun and fast; the interactive surface of the product could be visualized easily.

I learn a new way of prototyping, which is more obvious for the designer to design the journey of how the system interacts with users. Easy to make, clear to read, convenient to change.<br />

## web & portfolio

Some websites that I found very interesting from Karen’s list.

Uncanny Valley Studios https://uncannyvalley.studio/
<br />
Studio Wrk https://waaark.com/studio/

Going through what other artists/students’ website, I found that it does not need to be very complicated, just some showcase work. With a bit of patience and some practice, I can make my own one day.

Plan for my project
![]()


Members of Free Art and Technology (FAT), OpenFrameworks, the Graffiti Research Lab, and The Ebeling Group communities have teamed-up with a legendary LA graffiti writer, publisher and activist, named TEMPTONE. Tempt1 was diagnosed with ALS in 2003, a disease which has left him almost completely physically paralyzed… except for his eyes. This international team is working together to create a low-cost, open source eye-tracking system that will allow ALS patients to draw using just their eyes. The long-term goal is to create a professional/social network of software developers, hardware hackers, urban projection artists and ALS patients from around the world who are using local materials and open source research to creatively connect and make eye art.

Stranger Visions -- Heather Dewey-Hagborg

Artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg creates portrait sculptures from analyses of genetic material collected in public places. Working with the traces strangers unwittingly leave behind, Dewey-Hagborg calls attention to the developing technology of forensic DNA phenotyping and the potential for a culture of biological surveillance. Designed as an exploratory project based on emerging science, the forecast of Stranger Visions has proved prescient. For an example of DNA phenotyping at work in forensics check out the companies Parabon NanoLabs and Identitas and read about their collaboration with the Toronto police. Also see Mark Shriver's research at Penn State on predicting faces from DNA.

The Unseen Movie (2010) -- Ricardo O'Nascimento
Adding the "shut down" time to the 24 blinks per minute we can conclude that one has 1,2 seconds of blindness per minute which, in a 70 years life, is approximately 21 days with no vision.

In front, a monitor the user watches a movie. A camera on the top of the monitor is connected to a computer that tracks the eyes and detects when they blink. Every time the user blinks the image that appears at that moment is broadcasted in another monitor in real time.
