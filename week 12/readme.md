## Changes after week 12

Still struggling about how to style slider in p5, I did some HTML experiments but did not help. I only managed to style the height of the slider. I got feedback from week 12 that the text has been washed off, and also Andy suggested me to have a pattern background behind the frame.

## Reflection

Before walking into this studio, I have zero knowledge about generative art; I choose it because I think many potentials will happen within this studio. As a designer, I have been thinking of the future and the limit of design. Indeed, Karen gives the inspirational mini-lectures, which invoke my curiosity and draws to do the research. Along the journey, I saw the unlimited possibilities in this field of study, not only visuals that I have watched in open processing but also some topics discussed by artists in this field. I can tell the potential of interdisciplinary research/works happening.

With studies this semester, I gain a foundational level of coding skills; I know basic javascript; how to find references for future research, how to use the new library, how to debug. It is a big step for me, as I step out of my comfort zone to learn how to code. I am not afraid of bugs; I can calm down, test whatâ€™s wrong with my code little by little, and fix my mistakes by logic or syntax. There are many amazing effects on open processing and library that Karen recommended (like three.js) that I want to try out. I will keep this curiosity, carry it on for my future study.

It is fascinating to see projects from my peers; we have some similarities to connect but so different in the end. I feel lucky to work with my peers as a community, share knowledge, and support each other.

From the idea formed till now, I am proud of what I have developed, although there are still many imperfections. I had so many struggles in picking a workable plan and stick to it. My project is very close to the expectations that I set at the very beginning. I have learned so much from the beginning to now. I want to thank Karen, who helps me when I am having trouble working things out and giving me advice on making my fantasy happen. Andy, who has been providing advice on the design part of my project, appreciate the extra time and patience you give us.
