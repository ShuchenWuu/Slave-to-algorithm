Including hero image, UI, functions of the system at this stage

I tried to combine the front page and the system using an HTML link. However, that link stands on the page, and I have no idea how to edit it lol.
The solution at the moment is adding a URL into the mouse click function on the front page. The problem is that it takes time to load between those pages. 

## Feedback 

After consulting with Andy, he suggests choosing another typeface, which is not starch like the one that I am using now and to change the background colour. Karen told me HSB colour mode, which is brighter and clearer than RGB colour. Regarding linking two pages together, Karen offered to add their canvas to the system page, and I can hide the canvas by mouse click.

## Developing process

I changed the colour mode and decided to use light blue, which is bright and healing since this system aims for emotional relief. By using HSB mode, I reduced the number of sliders that control colours. I set a darker Saturation and Brightness for background colour and lighter for lines. With one single slider, users can make rainbow colours.

### Typeface 
Typeface trails for the system
(I do struggle a lot with this part…)

### Link two pages
I did solve it with the third canvas! And understand the flexibility of p5, I learned that I could have two function setups and call it when needed. Graphics does not have a hide function; however, for other elements in setups/function draw, they have hide() & show(); just call them when needed.
