### What
It is a generative interactive web system that can translate your emotions (by talking about it) into visuals. 

### How 
The input is human language; people can talk about things that they have been through/bother them; the system will translate their speech into numbers. By changing parameters (colours, shapes), they can produce drawings base on their speech. The system will listen to users’ speech and continuous draws while they speak. By the time they finish, they can save the image by clicking the “save image”button.

#### Why
This work aims to provide a private place for emotional relief. During the pandemic where everyone is staying at home, it is common to feel the unstableness of your emotions, and you might not have a way to let them go. There are organisations like Beyond Blue, offering support/hotline for mental wellbeing. However, during the lockdown, the support usually less than the public’s need. And sometimes, people need to talk to somebody and to set free their emotions. According to my research/interviews, many people do not want to hear complaints or any negative emotional expressions that might affect their positive emotions. Emotion Printer is a place to vent your negative emotions and a place to heal. It provides digital art therapy (all forms of technology-based media, including digital drawings) experience to users, and aim to process feelings, reduce stress and anxiety, and increase self-esteem. Users can share their drawings instead of negative emotions to others, which will not hurt both sides and experience the sense of “we are all going through this together”.
