Some questions that I had:
</br>
- If it is possible to make a site that people can upload their drawings?
</br>
- How to combine CSS, HTML, JS?
- Need a hoster and space

Manageable solution
</br>
Could be a button save images, does not necessarily need to upload to the browser.

## Feedback
Apart from the practical issue, Andy had talked to me and suggested some fantastic advice about how the make this website UI beautifully. He said the white box could be a baroque frame; reference is from the movie 2001. Sometimes you want to show futuristic design when it is hard to push further, a bit of backward(something old), that contrast can help!

## Process
### Problem Solved
- second canvas
- Save canvas
- More modes of shapes
- A front face of my system, some context, instructions
  Some interesting decorations using noise
- A bit of hit/intro about boxes and sliders

### The problem at the moment
Probably mouseClick function doe snot fit my situation to link these two pages together because those two pages both have some lines that can not be moved from function setup. 
Orâ€¦can I?

I move these two drawings into one processing file hopefully could be solved by HTML level instead of JS?
