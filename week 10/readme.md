Some questions that I had:
</br>
If it is possible to make a site that people can upload their drawings?
</br>
How to combine CSS, HTML, JS?
- Need a hoster and space

Manageable solution
Could be a button save images, does not necessarily need to upload to the browser.

## Feedback
Apart from the practical issue, Andy had talked to me and suggested some fantastic advice about how the make this website UI beautifully. He said the white box could be a baroque frame; reference is from the movie 2001. Sometimes you want to show futuristic design when it is hard to push further, a bit of backward(something old), that contrast can help!
